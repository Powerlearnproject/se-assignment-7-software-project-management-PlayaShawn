       Highly flexible,allows incremental delivery, regular customer feedback and improves quality by identifying issues early.
     Disadvantages:
       Very unpredictable,requires a high amount of team collaboration,and also requires experienced team.
      
    Waterfall:
       A linear and sequential software development approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
     Advantages:
       Clear structure and documentation.
       High predictability.
       Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
     Disadvantages:
       Difficult to accommodate changes.
       Late testing whichcan lead to late identification of defects.
       Delayed customer feedback.

    Scrum:
       An agile methodology where fixed-length iterations called sprints are used(lasts 2-4 weeks) to deliver incremental improvements of the software product.
     Advantages:
       Timely delivery.
       Focuses on the customer.
       Ensures high transparency.
     Disadvages:
       Some roles can be overloaded i.e scrum master.
       It is not suitable for all projects.
